If you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the “data controller” of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in Discord's Terms of Service). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller.

It’s important that you read this entire policy, but here’s a summary to get you started:

* **We give you control.** We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord.
* **We don't store any personal information.** We don't store emails, location, IP address, passwords or any personal identifiers. Only what Discord gives us.
* **We don’t sell your data.** Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products.
  
The information we collect[](#the-information-we-collect)
===========================================================

We collect certain information when you use YGO Omega. This includes information you provide to us and information we collect automatically.

Information you provide to us[](#information-you-provide-to-us)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Discord username.** When you login to YGO Omega, it requests Discord for username.
*   **Discord avatar.** When you login to YGO Omega, it requests Discord for avatar.

Information we collect automatically[](#information-we-collect-automatically)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We also collect information automatically from you when you use YGO Omega. This includes:

*   Information about the number of wins, losses, and draws for each ranked duel.
*   Information on the types of decks you use. (We do not reveal decklists).
*   Information on the cards used.
*   Information on which ranked queues you use. 

How we use your information[](#how-we-use-your-information)
=============================================================

We use your information for the following purposes:To fulfill our contract with you

*   To provide you with the services. For example, when you chat with your opponent, a Discord lobby is created which creates a connection between you and the opponent. Other players may join this lobby as spectators and also communicate with you. We do not store these messages that are displayed once the duel is over. Communication may be in the form of text messages or voice chat.
*   To contact you. We use your information to contact you in connection with your username. We may detect bugs on the server which involved your activity and hence, we would contact you to ask questions so that we can collect more information on how to reproduce that bug.
*   To provide customer service. We use your information to respond to your questions about our products and services, and to investigate bugs or other issues.
*   To track your game progress. The result of your duels (wins, losses, or draw), the decks you use, and the cards you use, helps create your own personal profile that you can access on the website.
 

**_In Short:_** _We use your information to track your game progress, communicate with you, and provide game statistics._

How we share your information[](#how-we-share-your-information)
=================================================================

*   Information about your game progress for ranked games is saved and shown in your personal profile accessible on the website.
  

Data retention[](#data-retention)
===================================

We retain data for as long as it is needed for the purposes for which we collected it. If your account is inactive for more than two years, we may delete it, and we may delete any information associated with your account. 
 
How to control your privacy[](#how-to-control-your-privacy)
=============================================================

We believe that users should be able to tailor their experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here’s how you can control how we process your information and how to request access to your information:

* You can choose to enable "Incognito Mode" from Settings. This will hide your Discord username, Discord avatar, card sleeves, and playmats from all other players using the game.
* You can choose to mute your opponent or spectators. The chat is disabled by default. If you enable chat, a disclaimer pops up which you agree to take responsibility for the content of the chat.
* You can choose to enable "Safe Mode" from Settings. This will hide other players' Discord username, Discord avatar, card sleeves, and playmats.

Be aware of the chats you choose to participate in. You can always choose what conversations to participate in and what information you give. You can choose what messages to send or post, who to engage with (e.g., one or more particular users or a potentially unlimited group of users), what information to include in your profile, whether to connect any third party services to your Discord account, and more. For example, if you share content in public spaces, it may be accessed by anyone.

We encourage players to practice self-moderation. Most games do not offer the ability to communicate with other players. We have allowed this feature to enhance the experience and community. There is no censorship of the chat. There is complete freedom of speech. You can mute any player(s) or block them from Discord and this will prevent that player(s) from communicating with you both in the game and on Discord.

We offer a number of settings that allow you to tailor your experience within YGO Omega.
